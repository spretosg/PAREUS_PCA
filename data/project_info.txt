## Additional Information for Trnava, Slovakia 


The Trnava Region is one of the eight Slovak administrative regions. It was established in 1996. It is located almost in the geographical center of Europe, near the Bratislava capital. Administratively, it consists of 7 districts: Dunajská Streda, Galanta, Hlohovec, Piešťany, Senica, Skalica and Trnava and there are 251 municipalities in the region (16 are towns). The region has an agricultural and forestry character. In the post-transformation period, industrial production strengthened significantly. Several foreign industrial establishments were located, dominated by automobile production (Peugeot, Citroën). The study area is significant in terms of the occurrence of natural resources. The soils of the study area belong to the most fertile soils in Slovakia and, together with favorable climatic conditions, create a high potential for the development of agriculture. Groundwater reserves and the occurrence of geothermal and curative sulfur waters are also important, on the basis of which the spa industry, recreation and tourism are developed. In addition to wood production, forest ecosystems are also an important source of biodiversity. Most of them are part of protected areas. The unique landscape structure of study area in the southern part is mainly the system of river branches - the inner Danube delta. The administrative and cultural center is the city of Trnava. It is one of the oldest medieval towns in Slovakia. It was probably founded at the end of the 9th century at the junction of important long-distance merchant roads and a small market village. Even today, there are many cultural and historical monuments, especially sacral ones. That is why it is often called "Little Rome". 

**The current situation of protected areas** 

There is an extensive network of protected areas in the region that covers 23 % of whole Trnava region. There are large-sized protected areas – 4 protected landscape areas: Dunajské Luhy, Biele Karpaty, Malé Karpaty and Záhorie and 10 Special Protection Areas (SPAs). Within the small-sized protected areas there are 7 national nature reserves, 27 nature reserves, 28 protected areas, 24 nature monuments, 1 national nature monument – the Driny cave, and 52 Sites of Community Importance. Protected areas are not evenly distributed. Most of the protected areas are concentrated in the peripheral parts of the region - the northern and southern parts formed by forest ecosystems. The minimum number of protected areas is located in the central part of the region, which is the typical intensively used agricultural area.

**Main improvements for protected areas**
To reach the 30x30 target, an increase of approximately 274.7 km2 of protected areas is necessary. Currently, a mostly homogenous agricultural landscape with intensive land-use represents 73 % of area and to increase biodiversity, landscape connectivity, and ecological stability, where the features of the territorial system of ecological stability  are not implemented yet. It is necessary to improve protection in agricultural landscape not only by connection but also by improving or renewing ecologically valuable patches (wetlands, woodlands, grasslands, degraded ecosystems). 

**Outcomes from the PAREUS project for the region**
- Potential mapping (spatial identification of sites) for OECM
- Creation of a network of stakeholders 
- Strengthening cooperation between the main stakeholder groups
