## Additional Information for Trøndelag, Norway 

Located in central Norway, the county of Trøndelag has a great richness of nature, landscapes and culture. The landscape varies between mountainous areas in the south and east, cultural landscapes in interior river valleys and a rugged coastline. The area plays a central role in the history of the indigenous Sami people, the Vikings and the Christians in Scandinavia. Closely connected to the nature, culture and history of Trøndelag, agriculture and fisheries evolved to a significant regional economy. For both local people and tourists, hiking and skiing are important activities to experience the great nature in Trøndelag. 

**The current situation of protected areas** 
Approximately 20% of the area in Trøndelag is considered as protected areas reaching from patches of several hectares up to a thousand square kilometers. The protected areas mainly cover mountainous areas with little vegetation, followed by forests and wetlands. Most of the protected areas are governed by regional or national authorities.  

**Main improvements for protected areas**
To reach the 30x30 target, an increase of approximately 8’000 km2 of protected areas is necessary. Mainly coastal and lowland ecosystems and their biodiversity are underrepresented in the current network of protected areas. While the protected areas in the mountains are larger and better connected, the protected areas close to the coast are more fragmented and isolated.  

**Outcomes from the PAREUS project for the region**
- A locally grounded, general understandable definition of OECM areas 
- A locally grounded wording regarding nature protection and nature conservation
- A spatial explicit catalog of areas that might be of potential to serve for OECM or protected areas
- Locally grounded understanding of a more dynamic nature protection that includes local socio-ecological values.
